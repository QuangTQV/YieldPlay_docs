## Platform Fee & Incentive Model

With a long-term target of **$50M in Total Value Locked (TVL)**, YieldPlay’s economic model is designed to create **sustainable incentives** for game studios, the platform, and players.

When players join an event or tournament, they pay a **small participation fee (around 0.5%)**. This fee is **not extracted as immediate revenue**, but is added directly to the **shared prize pool**, together with yield generated from DeFi protocols.

The key behavioral insight is:

* The longer players participate,
* The higher their chance to **recover the participation fee** and start earning net rewards.

This creates a strong **retention loop**, encouraging long-term engagement rather than one-off participation.

## Prize Pool at Scale

At **$50M TVL**, YieldPlay estimates the total prize pool to reach approximately **$5.5M**, composed of:

* Participation fees contributed by players
* Yield generated from DeFi protocols such as **Jupiter**

The prize pool is distributed transparently as follows:

* **4%** allocated to the **game developer**
* **3%** allocated to **YieldPlay**
* The **remaining portion** distributed to **winning players** across events and tournaments

## Outcomes

This model creates a balanced and sustainable ecosystem:

* **Game studios** gain a recurring revenue stream without relying solely on ads or in-app purchases
* **YieldPlay** earns long-term incentives aligned with platform growth
* **Players** receive meaningful rewards while retaining nearly all of their original principal

In short, YieldPlay turns **yield and small participation fees** into a long-term engagement engine, rather than a monetization barrier.

> The participation fee is intentionally kept low (≈0.5%) to avoid loss perception, while still contributing to prize pool growth and platform sustainability.
