# Prize Distribution

How prizes are calculated and distributed to winners.

## Distribution Model

### Winners (Top 3)
- **1st Place**: Original stake + 50% of yield
- **2nd Place**: Original stake + 30% of yield
- **3rd Place**: Original stake + 20% of yield

### Losers
- Original stake - optional boost fee (if used)

### Platform
- 2-5% of yield pool

## Example

Pool with 100 players × $100 stake:
- Total staked: $10,000
- Yield generated: $500
- Platform fee (3%): $15
- Prize pool: $485

**Payouts:**
- 1st: $100 + $242.50 = $342.50
- 2nd: $100 + $145.50 = $245.50
- 3rd: $100 + $97.00 = $197.00
- Others: $100 - $2 boost fee = $98.00

## Fair Selection

Winners are selected using VRF (Verifiable Random Function) from Chainlink/ORAO oracle, ensuring:
- Provably random
- Tamper-proof
