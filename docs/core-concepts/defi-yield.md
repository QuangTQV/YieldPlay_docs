# DeFi Yield

YieldPlay uses DeFi protocols to generate yield that funds prize pools.

## How It Works

When players stake into a pool:
1. Funds are deposited to Jupiter
2. DeFi protocol lends funds to borrowers
3. Borrowers pay interest
4. Interest becomes yield
5. Yield is distributed as prizes

## Example

- Pool size: $10,000
- APY: 5%
- Duration: 1 week
- Yield generated: $10,000 × 5% × (7/365) = ~$9.59

This $9.59 becomes the prize pool (minus platform fees).

## Supported Protocols

- Aave (Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum)
- Compound (Ethereum)
- More coming soon
