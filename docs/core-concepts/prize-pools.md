# Prize Pools

A prize pool is a collection of staked funds that generates yield to fund prizes.

## How Prize Pools Work

1. Players stake money into the pool
2. Staked funds are deposited into DeFi protocols (jupiter)
3. DeFi generates yield over time
4. Yield becomes the prize pool
5. Winners receive prizes, losers get refunds

## Prize Distribution

- 1st place: 50% of yield pool
- 2nd place: 30% of yield pool
- 3rd place: 20% of yield pool

## Pool Lifecycle

```
PENDING → ACTIVE → CHOOSING_WINNER → COMPLETED
```
