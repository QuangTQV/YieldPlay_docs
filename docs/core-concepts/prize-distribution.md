# Prize Distribution

How prizes are calculated and distributed in a **no-loss, yield-backed pool**.

---

## Distribution Model

### Winners (Top 3)

Winners receive their **remaining stake after participation fee** plus a share of the **reward pool**, funded by **DeFi yield and participation fees**.

* **1st Place**: Net stake + **50% of winners’ reward pool**
* **2nd Place**: Net stake + **30% of winners’ reward pool**
* **3rd Place**: Net stake + **20% of winners’ reward pool**

> Reward splits can be customized per game or tournament.

---

### Non-Winning Participants

* Receive their **net stake after fee**
* No additional loss beyond the **0.5% participation fee**

This preserves the **no-loss principle**, with a clearly defined and limited cost of participation.

---

### Platform & Game Studio

The **reward pool** (not player principal) is allocated transparently:

* **4%** → Game Studio
* **3%** → YieldPlay
* **Remaining portion** → Distributed to winners

---

## Example

### Pool Setup (1 Month)

* Players: **100**
* Stake per player: **$1,000**
* Participation fee (0.5%): **$5**
* **Net stake per player:** **$995**

**Total staked (TVL):**

* $995 × 100 = **$99,500**

---

### Rewards Generated

* DeFi yield (~0.5% / month): **$500**
* Total participation fees: **$500**

**Total reward pool:** **$1,000**

---

### Reward Allocation

* Game Studio (4%): **$40**
* YieldPlay (3%): **$30**
* Winners’ reward pool: **$930**

---

### Payouts

* **1st Place**

  * Reward: $465
  * **Total received:** $995 + $465 = **$1,460**

* **2nd Place**

  * Reward: $279
  * **Total received:** $995 + $279 = **$1,274**

* **3rd Place**

  * Reward: $186
  * **Total received:** $995 + $186 = **$1,181**

* **Non-winners**

  * **$995 returned** (no further loss)

---

## Fair Winner Selection

Winners are selected using **Verifiable Random Function (VRF)** powered by on-chain oracles (e.g. ORAO), ensuring:

* Provable randomness
* Tamper resistance
* Transparency and auditability

---

## Key Takeaways

* Maximum downside per player is **explicitly capped at 0.5%**
* No principal is used for rewards
* Yield + fees fund prizes sustainably
* Monetization aligns with engagement, not extraction
